# mros_reasoner

A meta-controller implementation for ROS1

## Installation

### Previous steps

#### Install java jre

The `mros_reasoner` uses  [Owlready2](https://owlready2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) to handle the ontologies and perform reasoning.

Owlready2 by default uses the [HermiT reasoner](http://www.hermit-reasoner.com/) which is written in Java, and thus you need a Java Vitual Machine to perform reasoning in Owlready2.

You can use this command **To install the Java Vitual Machine**

```console
sudo apt-get install openjdk-11-jre
```

Under Linux, Owlready should automatically find Java.

### Create reasoner_ws

- We recommend you to create a workspace only for `mros1_reasoner`, for example:

```console
  mkdir -p ~/mros1_reasoner_ws/src
  cd mros1_reasoner_ws
```

### Get mros1_reasoner and dependencies using wstool

- You need to copy the `mros1_reasoner` and its dependencies into the reasoner workspace (ie: `mros1_reasoner_ws`).

```console
  cd ~/mros1_reasoner_ws
  wstool init ~/mros1_reasoner_ws/src https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tud-cor/mc_mros_reasoner/master/mros1_reasoner/mros1_reasoner.rosinstall
  rosdep install --from-paths ~/mros1_reasoner_ws/src -y -i -r
```

**Note** The above `rosdep install` uses the `-r` argument in order to ignore possible errors. Please check the console output to make sure all dependencies are installed correctly.

### Build the code

- Once you have the workspace setup, you can build the workspace
- Do not forget to source ROS Melodic workspace before building your `mros1_reasoner_ws`

```console
source /opt/ros/melodic/setup.bash
catkin build
```

## User instructions

The mros1_reasoner node needs the following elements:

- an OWL model of the system to be metacontrolled. This can be manually created directly in OWL, e.g. using Protege, or it can be generated automatically from other models of the system ([rosin-experiments](https://github.com/rosin-project/rosin-experiments) provides a way to develop the model according to RosModel, and the script [`rosmodel2owl.py`](https://github.com/tud-cor/mc_mros_reasoner/blob/master/mros1_reasoner/scripts/rosmodel2owl.py) provides a way to transform it to OWL)
- monitoring and reconfiguration infrastructure for the given platform, e.g. for ROS1 reconfiguration capabilities are provided by [`ros_manipulator.py`](https://github.com/rosin-project/metacontrol_sim/blob/master/scripts/rosgraph_manipulator.py) and by the launchfiles in [metacontrol_move_base_configurations](https://github.com/rosin-project/metacontrol_move_base_configurations)

### Execution

Source your ws and launch the reasoner:

```console
source mros1_reasoner_ws/devel/setup.bash
roslaunch mros1_reasoner run.launch
```

### Testing

Two [rostest](http://wiki.ros.org/rostest) have been created for this package:

1. The **1-level functional architecture** test, which checks that the reasoner is capable of loading an `owl` file compliant with TOMAsys including:

    1. a Function and multiple FDs that solves it.
    1. QA performance values for the FDs.

    To run this first test use:

    ```console
    source mros1_reasoner_ws/devel/setup.bash
    rostest mros1_reasoner test_level_1_functional_arch.test
    ```

1. The **QA reception** test, checks wheter or not the reasoner can correctly receive a QA value and update it on its knowledge base.

    To run this second test use:

    ```console
    source mros1_reasoner_ws/devel/setup.bash
    rostest mros1_reasoner test_qa_reception.test
    ```
